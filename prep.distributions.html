  Cairo says that data distributions are analysed by establishing the norm of the set of data. The norm is then analysed according to different patterns. These patterns are identified as their natures.

The level of the distribution refers to how linear the data is. The level looks at the trendline of a set of data and determines how closely a linear equation will relate to the nature of the distribution. the Spreadof the data refers to how far apart the data is from eachother. The spread can tell how far the data points vary over say a measure of time. The shape of the data can suggest certain things at a certain point in the distribution. If say the distribution were to create a peaking shape, the data points at that peak might carry some significance. Outliers cause these natures to be difficult to gather analytical information from. An outlier will cause the level of a distribution to seem off in a trendline equation. When observing the spread of the data, an outlier can make the average spread between points bigger than the data norm is. Outliers, when reading the shape of the distribution, can cause some confusionm but does not effect how you see the shape of the data.
